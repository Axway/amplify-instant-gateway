A Virtual API Release can be deployed to a specified Amplify Gateway environment so that the virtual api can be called via the Amplify Gateway dataplane running in that environment. It is also possible to undeploy or remove a Virtual API Release from an Amplify Gateway environment.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a Virtual API Release as outlined in [Release Tag a Virtual API](/docs/usage/ReleaseTag/index.html).
* You have installed Amplify Gateway as outlined in [Install Amplify Gateway](/docs/install/index.html) and you have access to the Environment in which the Amplify Gateway is running.
