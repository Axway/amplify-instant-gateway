  Configuring JWT Bearer token Security for a Virtual API.
---

To specify that the Virtual API is to be secured via JWT Bearer Token, the user must configure a JWT Auth rule and update the Virtual Service to use that Auth Rule.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a Virtual API as outlined in [Create Virtual API](/docs/usage/create/index.html).

## Via the Amplify Management APIs

## Via Axway CLI

## Via UI

JWT auth rule cannot be configured via the UI currently.
