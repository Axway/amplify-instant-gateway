  Configure HTTP protocol to use when Amplify Gateway conmunicates with a backend api.
---

By default, Amplify Gateway will negotiate how to communicate with the backend api. If the backend api can support HTTP/2 then Amplify Gateway will communicate with the backend over HTTP/2. If the backend can only support HTTP/1.1 then all communication will take place over HTTP/1.1. It is possible to change this default configuration to specify that Amplify Gateway should communicate with the backend either exclusively over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. You may wish to do this if you know the capabilities of the backend and do not wish to incur the overhead of hte negotiation. Backends which do not support TLS cannot use HTTP/2.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a Virtual API as outlined in [Create Virtual API](/docs/usage/create/index.html).

## Via the Amplify Management APIs

To configure HTTP/2 setting via API call the following end-point

```markdown
PUT /management/v1alpha1/virtualapis/{virtualapiName}/virtualservices/{virtualserviceName}
```

where {virtualapiName} is the name of the Virtual API you wish to configure and {virtualserviceName} is the name of its corresponding virtual service. If the following json payload is provided then the virtual service will be updated to communicate exclusively over HTTP/2.

```json
{
    "group": "management",
    "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
    "kind": "VirtualService",
    "name": "music",
    "title": "music",
    "spec": {
        "route": [
            {
                "service": {
                    "codec": "HTTP2",
                    "prefix": "/music/v2",
                    "protocol": "https",
                    "endpoints": [
                        {
                            "host": "musicalinstruments.axway.com",
                            "port": 443
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "operations": [
                    {
                        "id": "MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 FindInstruments",
                        "path": "/instruments",
                        "method": "GET"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 FindInstrumentByID",
                        "path": "/instruments/{id}",
                        "method": "GET"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 QueryInstrument",
                        "path": "/instruments/query",
                        "method": "GET"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "prefix": "/music/v2"
    }
}
```

In this example, the specification:

* Has been updated to specify a codec of HTTP2 as opposed to AUTO (the default).
* All other values in the Virtual Service are unaltered.

To test HTTP settings, release and deploy the Virtual API as outlined in [Release Tag a Virtual API](/docs/usage/ReleaseTag/index.html) and [Deploy a Virtual API](/docs/usage/Deploy/index.html)

## Via Axway CLI

To configure HTTP/2 setting via CLI, , log on the Axway Central CLI and run the following command

```markdown
axway central apply -f music-updateHTTPSettings.yaml
```

A yaml file called music-updateHTTPSettings.yaml should exist on the file system with the following contents. Executing this command with the yaml file contents will update the virtual service to communicate exclusively over HTTP/2.

```yaml
group: management
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: VirtualService
name: music
title: music
metadata:
  scope:
    kind: VirtualAPI
    name: music
spec:
  route:
    - service:
        codec: HTTP2
        prefix: /music/v2
        protocol: https
        endpoints:
          - host: musicalinstruments.axway.com
            port: 443
      operations:
        - id: MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 FindInstruments
          path: /instruments
          method: GET
        - id: MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 FindInstrumentByID
          path: /instruments/{id}
          method: GET
        - id: MusicalInstrumentsAPI-2.0.4 QueryInstrument
          path: /instruments/query
          method: GET
  prefix: /music/v2
```

In this example, the specification:

* Has been updated to specify a codec of HTTP2 as opposed to AUTO (the default).
* All other values in the Virtual Service are unaltered.

To test HTTP settings, release and deploy the Virtual API as outlined in [Release Tag a Virtual API](/docs/usage/ReleaseTag/index.html) and [Deploy a Virtual API](/docs/usage/Deploy/index.html)

## Via UI

HTTP settings can be configured via the Backend tab of the Virtual API details screen.
